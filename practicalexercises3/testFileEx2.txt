The history of Albania forms a part of the history of Europe. During classical antiquity,
Albania was home to several Illyrian tribes such as the Ardiaei, Albanoi, Amantini, Enchele,
Taulantii and many others, but also Thracian and Greek tribes, as well as several Greek colonies
established on the Illyrian coast. In the 3rd century BC, the area was annexed by Rome and became
part of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia, Macedonia and Moesia Superior. Afterwards, the territory
remained under Roman and Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century.
